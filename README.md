United States School Finder (USSF)


Our application “USSF” will allow users to create a profile, search for schools filtered by location, public or private, desired extracurricular activities, and school grade. The app also allows schools to create a profile, and edit their properties. Additionally, users can save and edit selected schools to their profiles to track their favorites. The intended users for USSF are parents in the process of moving to a new area, and schools looking to create and edit their profiles. We utilized a simple and effective user interface to make it more user-friendly. This app is intended for iOS, Android, and PC users.
